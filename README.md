# Geolocation research

## How to start
All necessary data are in this repo, so the only thing you need to do first is to run the main script: `src/detect_move_static.py`. This script will parse the raw dataset, separate datasets of different `imei`, and conduct the pre-processing for the HMM modeling or prediction. Every results will be saved int the `img` and `result` folders.
