# Geolocation research

## How to start
First thing you need to do is putting the raw data file into the `data/` folder, then run the main script: `src/detect_move_static.py`. This script will parse the raw dataset, separate datasets of different `imei`, and conduct the pre-processing for the HMM modeling or prediction. Every results will be saved int the `img` and `result` folders.
